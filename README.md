# DDoS Detection using FGNN-E Framework

A Federated Graph Neural Network Ensemble (FGNN-E) based system designed to detect Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks from network traffic data while preserving data privacy.

## 🚀 Features
- Federated learning simulation across multiple clients
- Graph-based network traffic modeling
- Ensemble of GCN, GAT, and GraphSAGE models
- Privacy-preserving local training
- Performance evaluation using ROC, F1-score, and confusion matrix

## 🛠 Tech Stack
Python, PyTorch, Scikit-learn  
Graph Neural Networks (GCN, GAT, GraphSAGE)  
Federated Learning (FedAvg)  
Dataset: CIC-DDoS2019

## 🏗 Methodology
